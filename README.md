# Google-Chrome-Word-Replacer
Google Chrome Plugin that replaces words with other words.

# How it works
In the options tab of the plugin, you can define words that the plugin should replace on all websites.

The plugin searches for the words when the website is loaded but also in intervals to catch async content.

Add as many words as you want.

# But why?
Some of the news out there using special words that mean something else, lets correct that. Also its about having fun.
