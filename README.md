# Google-Chrome-Word-Replacer
Google Chrome Plugin that replaces words with other words.

# How it works
In the options tab of the plugin, you can define words that the plugin should replace on all websites.

The plugin searches for the words when the website is loaded but also in intervals to catch async content.

Add as many words as you want.

# How to use

1. Download or clone all the files to a folder of your choice

2. Open Google Chrome and type: chrome://extensions/

3. Click "load unpacked extension" and select the folder, the plugin is then loaded

4. On the plugin, second mouse button on it and click "options" to add words to find and replace and click "save"

5. done!

# But why?
Some of the news out there using special words that mean something else, lets correct that. Also its about having fun.
